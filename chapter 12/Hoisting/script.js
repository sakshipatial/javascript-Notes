// IT shows error in let var and const three of them becouse function exoression and class expression are not hoisted,
// = krke likho ge toh bo function expression.



// console.log(a);
// let a;// In case of let you can't acsess a before initialization
// means let ko access nhi kr skte before initialization 
// whenever you use liet or const , the decleration is hoisted at the top but initialization  doesn't happen.It can't be intialized. then a variable goes to temporary dead zone. 
//and same goes with const.
